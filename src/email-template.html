  <p>Howdy!</p>

    <? if (remainingDays === 1) { ?>
    Tomorrow
    <? } else if (isLastCall) { ?>
    Next Monday
    <? } else { ?>
    In
    <?= remainingDays ?> days
    <? } ?>
    me and
    <?= firstName ?> are having f2f.<br>
    I'm sure you want to help him grow and become a better version of himself. Please, do him a little favor and <b><a
        href="<?= formUrl ?>">fill this short feedback form</a></b>.<br>
    Your feedback is valuable to him as it helps him to continue growing in the right direction.</p>
  <p>
    Remember you can toggl the time spent on giving feedback. It's project <code>netguru</code>, task <code>Feedback</code>
  </p>
  <p>If you don't have any feedback about
    <?= firstName ?>, submit an empty form so I don't bother you with reminders.</p>
  <p>Thanks!</p>
