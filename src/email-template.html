      <? if (remainingDays === 1) { ?>
        Tomorrow
      <? } else if (isLastCall) { ?>
        Next Monday
      <? } else { ?>
        In <?= remainingDays ?> days
      <? } ?>
      me and <?= firstName ?> are having f2f.<br>
      I'm sure you want to help him grow and become a better version of himself. Please, do him a little favor and <b><a href="<?= formUrl ?>">fill this short feedback form</a></b>.<br>
      Your feedback is valuable to him as it helps him to continue growing in the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>If you don't have any feedback about <?= firstName ?>, submit an empty form so I don't bother you with reminders.</p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>
